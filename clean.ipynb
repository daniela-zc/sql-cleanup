    "## SQL File Cleanup Python Program\n",
    "This repository contains a Python program designed to clean up unwanted instructions from a SQL file. The program was initially created to facilitate the process of importing databases into a local environment, aiming for improved efficiency and less rudimentary methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the current version is specifically tailored for a Drupal CMS structure, it can be extended with additional methods to make it useful in various scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to use\n",
    "To utilize the program, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate an object with the location of the SQL file. This will create a temporary copy of the file, which will be used for modifications, while the original file remains intact.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. The program currently offers three main methods:\n",
    "    - **removeSets:** This method receives a list of set instructions to be removed.\n",
    "    - **changeToUTF8:** This method allows you to specify the collation to be replaced with UTF8 (default).\n",
    "    - **removeDumbData:** This method receives a list of tables to be excluded. It is particularly useful for removing dumping data related to files that you do not wish to import into your local environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes\n",
    "As a Python newbie, creating this program was an enjoyable learning experience. I would greatly appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Feel free to reach out and help me discover better ways to accomplish the desired functionality.\n"
